# The Idea Behind 'mutt'
#
Mutt is a multi-language, multi-platform, multi-developer, multi-purpose code converter. The idea is that most programmers and developers are familiar with a number of different programming languages, and if I had to guess I'd venture to say that in most cases the average programmer is fluent in at least two or more.  The main purpose of 'mutt' will be to allow programmers to create code conversion functions from one programming language to another as they have time to do so and hopefully over time, this utility will be able to successfully convert almost any programming code into any other programming language. If this catches on, I suspect it will be a massive project in time and will be interesting to watch.

I'm new to developing on GitHub but I've been writing code for years. I have used GitHub and Git many times over the years but developing here is new to me, and this is the first project I have started. 

I realize that this project, when considering what is involved, is a daunting and intimidating task but if other programmers are like I am then there isn't much that is worse than writing an excellent program in a popular programming language that eventually becomes obsolete and then slowly fades into obscurity, and afterwords, being left with the choice of either completely rewriting all of the code or just walking away from the project completely.  But wouldn't it be nice if there were another viable choice out there, a choice that would solve the issue by allowing a programmer to simply import the obsolete code into an app and spit it out bright and shiny and new on the other side, all with the click of a button?

With mutt, the more programmers who get involved, and the more languages that people begin to write conversion functions for, the more programmers you will see begin to help with the project and the faster you will see them join the effort. Even if you only contribute a single function to convert one programming function to a different language, it is a function we weren't able to convert yesterday and today we can, so we can all be happy with that progress. Here, any progress is good progress, as long as it produces stable and accurate results in doing what it is supposed to do. Also, if the goals of this project are acheivable, then every developer on the planet has an interest in this project, even the ones who don't know it yet.

The reason I call the project 'mutt' is because that's what you get when you mix a bunch of dogs and produce a new one, a mutt. Since we're all pretty much a bunch of dogs, and so are programming languages, I figured the name was fitting for the project. It's really a term of endearment because most mutts are loveable creatures even if the dogs that made them weren't.

We've all put in enough effort for other people and it hasn't always received the appreciation it's worthy of, but this is one of those less common opportunities when all the effort you put into a project should eventually benefit you directly in a truly meaningful way at some point in time. There isn't a doubt in my mind that most, if not all developers should be able to see the value in a virtual guarantee such as that.  That said, I look forward to seeing some new people here in the future, and hopefully they might be able to help me along in learning to use this GitHub system as well.
