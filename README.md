# mutt
Mutt is a multi-language, multi-platform, multi-developer, multi-purpose code converter. The idea is that most programmers and developers are familiar with a number of different programming languages, and if I had to guess I'd venture that in most cases the average programmer is fluent in at least two or more.  The main purpose of 'mutt' will be to allow programmers to create code conversion functions from one programming language to another as they have time to do so and hopefully over time, this utility will be able to successfully convert almost any programming code into any other programming language. If this catches on, I suspect it will be a massive project in time and will be interesting to watch.
